# react-test-assignment

Create a REACT single-page application.

1. The home page is a table of users, which shows data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users, with the following columns: name, email, company name. 
2. Add the ability to filter the table by name and email.

3. When selecting a user in the table - show a list of posts done by this user (get data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts - see also Filtering resources). 

4. Add Create post button to list of posts screen that will open a dialog where user can enter details to create the post (see Creating a resource - note that resource will not be really created on the server but it will be faked as if)


Use a component library of your choice to looks professional (e.g. https://material-ui.com/, https://ant.design/, or anything you like).
