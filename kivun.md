This test will help us evaluating your hands-on skills on web front-end development. Our front-end technology strategy is based on 
[REACT](https://reactjs.org) but we are open to evaluate skills based on other single-page framework (Angular, ViewJS...). 

Please create a public github repository that will implement the following requirements 

# Mandatory requirements

Create a single-page application.

1. The home page is a table of users, which shows data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users, with the following columns: name, email, company name. 
To save time on styling, use [material-ui basic table](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-table/#basic-table) for styling

2. Add a filter input to provide the ability to filter the table by name and email.

# Additional (non manatory) requirements

3. Display a list of posts done by the selected user (get data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts - see also Filtering resources). 

4. Add Create post button to list of posts screen that will open a dialog where user can enter details to create the post (see Creating a resource - note that resource will not be really created on the server but it will be faked as if)

# Recommendations
1. Create an easy to read code, and ensure you do understand your own code, since our interview will focus on your code
